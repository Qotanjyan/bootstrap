                    I was born in 1997 in the city of Vanadzor,Lori region.At the age of 2 my family moved
                    to the capital Yerevan and we still live here. I attended primary school No 179 in Yerevan in 2004,
                    then high school No 105 in 2013,with a focus
                    on history and law subjects.In 2015,I enrolled in the Department of Journalism at Yerevan State
                    University. In 2018,
                    in parallel with my undergraduate studies, I started attending an art studio,where I mastered
                    creativity. I graduated
                    from the Department of Journalism at 2019.The same year, I had experience working in the newsroom of
                    Public Television.
                    In 2019,I enrolled a master's degree in Public Relations & Communication Technology in the same
                    Department,
                    where I began studying public relations.I graduated from the art studio in 2020. In parallel with
                    my studies at
                    university, I began to acctively create, in particular I practiced painting & established my own
                    clothing brand,the basis
                    of which is clothe modeling & creative work in the context of painting on textiles. In 2021 I
                    graduated with honors
                    with a master's degree in public relations.As the begining of creativity activity I will single out
                    making clay jewelry,
                    which,however,didn't have a long life and lasted for half a year.Along with attending the art
                    studio,I painted on canvases
                    and it became a source of inspiration for me. At the end of 2019, I created Poghosianarts,my own
                    brand of painted clothe,
                    which has become an even greater source of motivation.I'm engaged in both painting and painting in
                    textile focusing on the
                    role of public relations at the basis of both activities.I have painted over 50 canvases and over
                    800 outfits, the latter
                    mostly on an order basis.The canvases are entirely my creations,and the clothes are sometimes the
                    result of being inspired
                    by motives from famous paintings.But for half a year now I have been painting only my own creations
                    on clothes. In doing so, I have often introduced myself to the public and as a result of my activism
                    through the media I have talked about my creations, which I work on daily.

            On april 9, 2022 I opened my first solo exhibition at the Union of Artists of Armenian, where I presented my
            original paintings, modeled clothes, and outfits created on the bases of applied art. The
            exhibition
            ended on April 13.
            I use social media,especially Instagram and Facebook, as a platform to spread creative activity. In the near
            future
            I am going to open my own personal studio of applied art, where I will also teach people iterested in this
            direction.
            My plans definitly included both opening a studio and holding an exhibition and there is one more thing that
            I haven't
            implemented yet. Let me open a parenthesis and say that it is about having a shwroom. First I held the
            exhibiton,
            because the moment was ripe and I had so much work to present to the public and people could see and
            appreciate my work.
            The exhibition presented absolutely my own works, as well as paintings created on the basis of samples of
            Artsakh's century-old
            carpet weaving, particularly applied art, namely paintings presented on clothing.The step was to open an art
            studio,
            which I will talk about next.

                    As I mentioned the exhibition was to be followed by the opening of a studio.The idea
                    of
                    opening a
                    studio was that I needed a space that would be a source of inspiration for me to be
                    creative, where
                    I could create paintings approved by my clients. The studio was a source of
                    kind of
                    self-sufficency for me. I mean I could be in my environment. And I come just to create something new
                    and become even more professional in my filed.
