                    I was born in the city of Vanadzor in Lori region in 1997.At the age of 2 we moved with our family
                    to the capital
                    Erevan. In 2004 I attended 179 primary school of Yerevan then in 2013 I attended 105 high school
                    department of historical and juridical subjects. In 2015 I was admitted to the faculty of Journalism
                    of Yerevan State University.Parallel to my bachelor's studies I started attending an art studio
                    where I have mastered towards creativity in 2019 I graduated from the faculty of journalism of
                    Yerevan State Univesity.In the same year I had experience in the news department of the Public
                    Television Company.In 2019 I was admitted to the public relations and communication technologies
                    master's program of the same faculty. My art studio studies I finished in 2020. I express my
                    artistic nature especially through painting. Then I established my clothing brand based on clothing
                    modeling and creative work in the context of textile painting.As the beginning of creative activity,
                    I'll single out the making of clay jewelry, which, howerever, didn't have a long life and lasted for
                    half a year. Along with attending the painting studio, I painted canvases, which became a source of
                    inspiration.At the end of 2019 I created my own clothing brand whic has become an even greater
                    source of motivation. I'm engaged in both painting and textile painting giving great importance to
                    the role of public relations at the basis of both. I painted more than 50 canvases and more than 800
                    clothes, the later mostly on an order basis. The canvases are entirely my creations and the clothes
                    are sometimes inspired by the motives of famous paintings, However it has been half a year already
                    that only my creations are painted on the clothes.

            In april 9, 2022 I opened my first solo exhibition at the Union of Artists of Armenian, where my
            original
            paintings, modeled clothes, and outfits created on the bases of applied art where presented. The
            exhibition
            ended on April 13.In my plans clearly included both opening a studio and having an exhibition and there
            is
            one more that I haven't implemented yet. Opening the parentheses, let me say that we are talking about
            having a showroom. At first I held the exhibition,because the moment was ripe and I had so much work
            that I
            could present to the public and people could see and appreciate my work. In the exhibition were
            presented
            asolutely my own works, as well as works created on the basis of samples of Artsakh's century-old carpet
            weaving, particularly applied art, namely works presented on clothing. Modeled and painted clothes were
            presented according to my idea as well as a sale of the presented assortment was organized.The next step
            was
            to open an art-studio, which i will talk about next.

                    As I mentioned the exhibition was to be followed by the opening of a studio.The idea
                    of
                    opening a
                    studio was that I needed a space that would be a source of inspiration for me to be
                    creative, where
                    I could create works that were approved by my clients. The studio was a source of
                    some
                    self-sufficency for me, that I am in my environment and I come here just to create
                    something
                    new and
                    show more profesiional approach to my work.
